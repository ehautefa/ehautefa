## Hi there!
I'm a software engineer. I have a degree in Environnement Engineering from Polytechnique Lausanne and have worked on a variety of projects in my cursus on the 42 Paris School, ranging from web development to system administration.

Some of my notable projects include:

[Transcendence](https://github.com/ehautefa/42-2022-transcendence):  
A web app that allows users to play pong, interact with others users threw a chat and a friends system. Built using React and Nest.js.  

[Inception](https://github.com/ehautefa/Inception):   
Set up a small infrastructure composed of 3 services, mariaDB, wordpress and Nginx with docker compose.

[Server IRC](https://github.com/ehautefa/IRC_server):
Basic implementation of an irc server in cpp

I'm always looking to learn and grow as a developer, and am particularly interested in exploring new technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence. If you have any questions or want to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out!
