# Hi, I'm Elise Hautefaye
I'm a software engineer with a degree in Environmental Engineering from Polytechnique Lausanne. I have worked on a variety of projects during my time at 42 Paris, ranging from web development to system administration.

Some of my notable school projects include:
- [Transcendence](https://github.com/ehautefa/42-2022-transcendence): A web app that allows users to play pong, interact with others through a chat and a friends system. Built using React and Nest.js.
- [Inception](https://github.com/ehautefa/Inception): Set up a small infrastructure composed of 3 services (mariaDB, wordpress, and Nginx) using docker compose.
- [Server IRC](https://github.com/ehautefa/IRC_server):   Basic implementation of an IRC server in C++.

I then did an internship in [Smart-Chain](https://www.smart-chain.fr/), a Paris-based startup that provides web3 solutions for web2 companies. I worked on an NFT marketplace on polygon as a fullstack developer. _(STACK : React + Strapi)_

I'm currently working at [Quanthome](https://www.quanthome.com/), a Swiss startup that sells data-driven information for every real estate decision. _STACK: React/NodeJS/Koa/Knex/PostgreSQL_


I'm always looking to learn and grow as a developer, and am particularly interested in exploring new technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence.
