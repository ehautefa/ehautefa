# Hi, I'm Elise Hautefaye
I'm a software engineer with a degree in Environmental Engineering from Polytechnique Lausanne. I have worked on a variety of projects during my time at 42 Paris, ranging from web development to system administration.

Some of my notable projects include:
- [Transcendence](https://github.com/ehautefa/42-2022-transcendence): A web app that allows users to play pong, interact with others through a chat and a friends system. Built using React and Nest.js.
- [Inception](https://github.com/ehautefa/Inception): Set up a small infrastructure composed of 3 services (mariaDB, wordpress, and Nginx) using docker compose.
- [Server IRC](https://github.com/ehautefa/IRC_server):   Basic implementation of an IRC server in C++.

I'm always looking to learn and grow as a developer, and am particularly interested in exploring new technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence.  
I'm currently looking for a challenging and dynamic software engineering internship at a forward-thinking company where I can utilize my skills and knowledge to make a meaningful contribution.  
If you have any questions or want to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out!
